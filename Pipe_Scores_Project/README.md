# Predicting Utility Pipe Structural Scores

### Research Question
Can material type, age, length, and operational score be used to predict the structural score of a utility pipe?

### Motivation
Cities maintain intricate networks of gravity pipes which convey wastewater and drainage. This infrastructure is critical to maintaining public health and safety; failures can be catastrophic in terms of construction costs, property damage, and impacts to daily operations.

Currently, maintenance workers manually log a structural score based on visual analysis of CCTV recordings. This process is time consuming and it is nearly impossible to get full coverage in a network with over 100,000 pipes. Using machine learning to predict pipe defects could help fill in null values, reduce maintenance crew workload, and help prioritize maintenance.
